    <h1>An Inside Look Into Our Team at Helikoid AI</h1>
    <p>In just eight months, Helikoid AI has evolved from a bold idea between two friends into a powerhouse of 14 top-tier professionals. Our journey is more than just about growth—it's a testament to our commitment to revolutionize AI adoption.</p>
    <h3>Building an AI Powerhouse in a Talent-Scarce Industry</h3>
    <p>Recognizing the acute talent shortage in the AI sector, we embarked on creating Helikoid Education, a thriving community of over 35,000 aspirants spanning marketing, development, and sales—all united by their fascination with AI. This initiative hasn't just positioned us as an authority in the AI domain; it's our secret weapon in nurturing and attracting world leading AI talent.</p>
    <h3>Leadership That Inspires</h3>
    <p>At the helm is Liam Ottley, CEO and co-founder, one of the worlds leading AI educators and seasoned developer. Alongside him is Josh Brown, co-founder and COO, a specialist in marketing and operations with a history of shaping strategies for global brands. In May 2023, we welcomed Spencer Porter as our Chief Technology Officer. With over a decade in development and a rich background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Spencer brings a wealth of experience and innovation to our team.</p>
    <h3>A Melting Pot of Talent</h3>
    <p>Our team is a blend of expertise and passion. AI and Machine Learning experts Alex Ripperton and Ford Lascari, Front End engineers James Oldham and Casey Kristof, UI/UX specialist Clinton Murphy, and part-time product manager Matteo Giuzzi (also a Senior Product Manager at Meta) are the wizards behind our tech. Supporting them is a diverse team of marketing, support, financial, and legal aces—each playing a pivotal role in our success story.</p>
    <h3>Cultivating the Next Wave of AI Innovators</h3>
    <p>Helikoid isn't just a company; it's a launchpad for future AI leaders. Through Helikoid Education, we're nurturing raw talent, infusing fresh ideas into our team, and continuously pushing the envelope in AI innovation.</p>
    <h3>Our Philosophy: Cool Sh!t With Cool People</h3>
    <p>We're not just about groundbreaking work; we're about creating an environment where excitement and camaraderie are part of the daily routine. At Helikoid, our philosophy is simple - wake up each day to work on cool sh!t, with cool people. Because, at the end of the day, that's what makes the journey worthwhile. Join us on this exhilarating ride as we redefine what's possible with AI. Together, let's create, innovate, and lead the charge into a new era of technology.</p>
